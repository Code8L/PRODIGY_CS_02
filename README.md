This was the Second Task Assigned to me by Prodigy InfoTech to develop a program that manipulates pixels as a way to encrypt an image
In alignment with that i created a program that works a little similar to the Caesar cipher, it manipulates the pixels in a specified field and shifts their placement on the image, making the image scrambed like and 
had to translate 
and then it decrypts the image into its previous form and saves it.
